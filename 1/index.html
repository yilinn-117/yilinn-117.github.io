    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>
        In this project, I try to align three greyscale pictures denoting color channels and synthesize them into one color picture. I used the following approach 
        to finish this task: 
        I used standard deviation in color intensity to crop the side. If the standard deviation of a row or a column is under a certain value, I assume that that row/column is all black/white and hence remove it. 
        I then used NCC as a criterion to see how much each of the two matrices correspond to each other. Using the blue channel as a base, I searched through a given margin for the best NCC between green/blue and red/blue and adjusted the position accordingly.
        For tif images, I used a Gaussian pyramid to speed up the calculation. I used a 4 layer pyramid, where the top layer is the original image and the subsequent layers are 1/2, 1/4, and 1/8 in size compared to the original.
        The bottom layer would search through a margin of [-20,20] in both vertical and horizontal directions, and the top layer would only seach in a [-5,5] margin due to computational complexity, the middle layer used 15 and 10 as margin accordingly.
        After the alignment, I balanced the color intensity and contrast to improve the final quality.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        We could see that most of the images appeared to be okay after my processing. In some of the images the red channel isn't aligned perfectly (there is a small red outline visible), I assume that this is due to the final margin being set too low (-5,5), but I think this is a necessary compromise
        for efficiency, the TIF
        images on average take 3 minutes to process, if I extend the margin on the final search, the time would vastly increase.
        Apart from the quality issue mentioned above, one image turns out to be really bad: the emir.tif, I assume this is due to some angle disimilarity between the three color channels and requires another dimention (angle between channels) during margin search to align perfectly.
